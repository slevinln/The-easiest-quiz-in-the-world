# The Easiest Quiz In The World

A quiz website designed to test the user on deceptively easy questions. They appear self-explanatory, but are not intuitive.

Important! Unfortunately, the project couldn't be finished before the deadline due to a severe case of procrastination and contains a large amount of external code. See the credits section for the link.
The ReadMe is also unfinished.

## Features

### General Page Structure

The content ist structured straight from top to bottom for easy readability.
This helps the reader follow the page layout easily.

### Technologies Used

The website is written in the following languages:

HTML was used for the main site content.

CSS was used for styling the design and layout.

Javascript was used for creating the quiz (see the Credits section for the code).

### Testing

### Credits

As a student at CodeInstitute, I regularly used their Essentials Modules for creating this project.
This project was built following the "Love Maths" project from CodeInstitute.

As commented in the code, I originally wanted to use a quiz tutorial as a starting point, but didn't manage to finish the project in time. The code is from <https://simplestepscode.com/javascript-quiz-tutorial/>

#### Content

The questions are based on historical facts; however, the questions were not designed by me. I remembered them from about 15 years ago, when I saw them on www.deecee.de and they stuck in my head since then. They are no longer on the site and I rediscovered them on this page: http://www.kirchner-raddestorf.de/jikirchner/junk/tstblond.htm
The page is written in german. The origin is credited to a "Live TV" quiz show, but I couldn't find more infos through my research.
